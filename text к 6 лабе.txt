Were are the crowd
We’re c-comin’ out

Got my flash on, its true
Need that picture of you
It so magical
We'd be so fantastico

Leather and jeans
Garage Glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing light
Cause you know that baby I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa, 
PAPARAZZI
Baby there's no other superstar--
You know that I'll be
Your Papa- PAPARAZZI
lyrics Lady GaGa - Paparazzi òåêñò ïåñíè
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby you'll be famous, 
chase you down until you love me
Papa, PAPARAZZI

I'll be your girl 
Backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars 
yeah, cause you're my rockstar
In between the sets,
Eyeliner and cigarettes

Shadow is burnt-
Yellow, dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry
It don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
Cause you know that baby I

Real good, we dance in the studio
Snap snap, to that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone 
We're plastic, but we still have fun
